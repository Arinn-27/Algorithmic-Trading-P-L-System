# Algorithmic-Trading-P-L-System
 

### **Project Overview: `algorithmic-trading-p-l-system`**

As a third-year Arts and Business (Co-Op) student at the University of Waterloo, I've developed this project to apply my academic knowledge in Economics and Computing to personal financial management. The `algorithmic-trading-p-l-system` is a tool for tracking investment performance and formulating strategic exit plans. It goes beyond simple portfolio tracking by providing a robust framework for **strategic decision-making** and **risk management**.

The goal is to not only monitor my holdings but also to model how different **exit strategies**—based on profit targets or stop-loss limits—would have performed historically. This helps me test my investment hypotheses in a risk-free environment, applying concepts from financial economics to practical programming.

### **Key Features**

* **Real-Time P&L Tracking:** The system connects to a financial API to monitor and calculate the real-time profit and loss for each stock in the portfolio, as well as the overall portfolio value. This gives a dynamic, up-to-the-minute view of investment health.
* **Algorithmic Exit Strategy Modeling:** This is the core of the project. It allows me to define and simulate algorithmic rules for selling a position. For example, I can model an exit strategy that sells a stock once it reaches a **20% gain** or a **10% loss**. The system then back-tests this rule against historical data, providing a tangible way to evaluate the strategy's effectiveness.
* **Portfolio Diversification Analysis:** The program analyzes and visualizes portfolio diversification across sectors, asset classes, and geographical regions. This helps me identify and manage **concentration risk**, a key component of modern portfolio theory.
* **Data Visualization:** Interactive charts and graphs are used to present complex data clearly, making it easy to identify trends, compare different stocks, and understand overall portfolio dynamics at a glance.

### **Technical Skills Demonstrated**

* **Programming:** The project is built using **Python** for its robust data manipulation capabilities.
* **Data Analysis:** I use libraries like **Pandas** and **NumPy** to perform complex financial calculations and data aggregation.
* **Visualization:** I leverage **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create compelling data visualizations, turning raw numbers into insightful graphs.
* **API Integration:** The system connects to external financial APIs to fetch live market data, showcasing my ability to integrate different services.
* **Financial Modeling:** The back-testing and P&L calculations demonstrate a practical understanding of financial principles.

This project is a powerful example of how I can combine my economic knowledge with my programming skills to solve a real-world problem. It showcases my ability to manage a long-term project and create a tool with tangible utility, making it a valuable addition to my resume.
